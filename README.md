# WeatherAPI Project

A simple and intuitive weather application that fetches live weather data for any location using the **WeatherAPI**. The app provides detailed information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and weather conditions in a user-friendly graphical interface built with **Tkinter**.

## Features

- **Real-time weather data**: Fetches live weather information from **WeatherAPI**.
- **Location-based weather**: Allows users to enter a city name to fetch weather data for that location.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Uses **Tkinter** for a clean and interactive interface.
- **Weather icons**: Displays weather condition icons based on the fetched data.
- **Error handling**: Covers possible issues like no internet connection, invalid location, and API errors, ensuring the program does not crash unexpectedly.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need to set up the following:

- Python 3.6+ (Recommended: Python 3.9 or above)
- Required Python packages (which can be installed via `pip`):
  - `requests`
  - `Pillow`
  - `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

### To install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests Pillow
```

## Setting Up WeatherAPI

This app uses **WeatherAPI** to fetch weather data. Follow these steps to set up the API:

1. **Sign up for WeatherAPI**:
   - Visit the [WeatherAPI website](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and sign up for an account.
   - After signing up, you will receive an **API key**.

2. **Create API key folder**:
   - Under the `WeatherAPI` folder, create a new folder named `apikey`.

3. **Add the API key**:
   - Inside the `apikey` folder, create a file named `API_KEY.txt`.
   - Paste your **WeatherAPI** API key inside `API_KEY.txt`.

   Your project directory should look like this:

   ```
   WeatherAPI/
       ├── apikey/
       │   └── API_KEY.txt
       ├── libs/
       └── ...
   ```

4. **Running the app**:
   - Once you have the API key setup, you are ready to run the application.
   - Simply run the `WeatherAPI.py` script in your Python environment.

## Key Features

- **Weather Data Retrieval**: The app retrieves weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and condition for the user-specified city.
- **Graphical UI**: The weather data is displayed in a neat and structured manner using a GUI built with **Tkinter**.
- **Image Display**: Weather condition icons are displayed alongside the weather information.
- **Error Handling**: The program includes robust error handling to manage:
  - **Internet connection issues**
  - **Invalid city name or API error responses**
  - **Missing or invalid API key**

## Exception Handling

This project covers various potential exceptions that could cause the program to crash:

1. **FileNotFoundError**: Handles missing API key file gracefully.
   - If the API key file is missing, the program will log an error and terminate without crashing.

2. **requests.ConnectionError**: Ensures that the application won't crash if the internet is not available.
   - If there’s no internet connection, the program will notify the user and terminate gracefully.

3. **Invalid API Response**: Handles situations where the WeatherAPI returns an error (e.g., incorrect city name or API issues).
   - If the API returns a 400 or other error codes, the program logs the error and notifies the user.

4. **KeyError**: Catches cases where some weather data may be missing in the API response.
   - If any expected data is missing (e.g., condition icon or temperature), the program won’t crash but will provide a fallback value or error message.

5. **Other Errors**: Catches general exceptions and ensures that the program can fail safely.

## How It Works

1. When the program starts, it automatically fetches weather data for the user's current location based on their IP address.
2. The user can enter a city name via a custom dialog box to fetch weather data for a specific location.
3. The application displays the weather data along with an icon representing the weather condition.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Not Working**: Double-check that your `API_KEY.txt` file contains the correct API key and is located in the `WeatherAPI/apikey` folder.
- **No Internet Connection**: Make sure that you have an active internet connection to fetch weather data.
- **Invalid City**: If you enter an invalid city name, the program will display an error message indicating that the location could not be found.
